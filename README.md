## About Me
I'm a builder and creator at heart.

For over a decade, I've been immersed in the software consulting world, working across industries such as IP Advertising, Healthcare, Telecom, and E-Commerce. I've helped companies understand and solve complex problems while leading teams to drive progress. I aim to share my learnings and pitfalls to build momentum.

The Repos here are quick graveyard fodder, but if you find any use of them fantastic!   
The bulk of my work lives with Clients in their domain.

When time allows, I try to write "How to's" and snippets for future me in the form of [blog posts](https://mthomps4.com/blog). 
This is never as often as I would like, but there's a better chance you will find information more organized there.
