## About Me
I'm a builder and creator at heart.

For over a decade, I've been immersed in the software consulting world, working across industries such as IP Advertising, Healthcare, Telecom, and E-Commerce. I've helped companies navigate and solve complex challenges while leading teams to drive meaningful progress. My goal is to share the lessons I've learned (and the mistakes I've made) to help others build momentum.

Most of the public repositories on this account are quick prototypes destined for archival. Many are simple "initializations" aimed at exploring new areas of technology and assessing their potential for future projects. The majority of my work resides with my clients, under their domain. If you find something useful here, that's fantastic!

When time permits, I try to write "how-to" guides and snippets for my future self, often in the form of [blog posts](https://mthomps4.com/blog). It's never as frequent as I'd like, but you're more likely to find organized content there.
